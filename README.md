# ðŸ’Œ epistolary

I find writing emails to be one of the most tedious and unpleasant tasks of my day. But I find the act of handwriting to be one of the most pleasant! The reMarkable is an e-ink tablet with a very pleasant writing experience. This software allows you to respond to emails by writing on the reMarkable, and then sends an OCR'd version of your writing to the recipient.
